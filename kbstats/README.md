kbstats
=======

A script that gets more detailed statistics on the KB, including counts by category, total Bugtraq items, etc.  

Great information to present to senior management (e.g. Our VM program's Knowledgebase currently has over 10,500 entries, including 148 that detect active backdoors and trojans).
