# score

This script, like vulnsummary.pl, demonstrates how to connect to the QualysGuard API, and how to extract and display data from the scan report XML document.

It displays an overall vulnerability score, calculated by adding the severity levels of the individual vulnerabilities detected during a scan.

Note: This script takes a username and password as the first two command line arguments.
